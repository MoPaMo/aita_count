Ever wondered who really gets voted what on r/AmItheAsshole? I analyzed a thousand posts on Reddit to uncover how objective the votes truly are...

### Website
Head over to https://whostheasshole.glitch.me/ to see the data presented in a visually appealing way (at least, I hope you’ll find it appealing)!

### Method
My app collects the top 1,000 posts (either from all time or just the last year).
It then looks at the top comment for each post, searching for one of these verdicts: NTA, YTA, ESH, or NAH. If it doesn’t spot one of these in the top comment, it moves on to the next highest-rated comment in the post.

### Limitations
It’s worth noting that the data on this website might not be 100% spot-on. Here’s why:
1. It only considers the top comment(s) for each post.
2. It only looks at the highest-ranking posts.

Unfortunately, gathering more data isn’t possible due to Reddit’s restrictions – they only allow you to collect up to 1,000 posts at a time.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
